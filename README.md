# Texas holdem game
A little game written by Python during my college.

1. Run 'Train.py'.  Try to set the value of N which denotes the times of self-confrontation, defalut value is N = 2000.

2. Obtain a file named 'train_data.csv', this will cost you so much time because of my complicated program. 

3. You can play Texas-hold-em with your PC by running 'Main.py' now! Good luck!

(PS:The larger N you choose,the better your PC performs.)

## Files
+ Main: After running, the computer reads the data of Probability to adjust the strategy of playing cards and play games with the players.

+ Train: Data on multiple rounds of points and wins & losses are obtained through self-confrontation,then 'train_data.csv' will be created.

+ Probability: Calculate the data generated by 'train_data.csv' to get the winning rate based on the current number of points

+ Probability results: A lot of self-confrontation leads to a winning or losing table.
