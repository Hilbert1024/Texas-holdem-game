# Texas-hold-em
A little game written by Python during my college.
First run 'Train.py',you can set N that the times of self-confrontation,defalut is N=2000.
Then we obtain a file named 'train_data.csv'.
You can play Texas-hold-em with your PC by running 'Main.py' now!Good luck!
(PS:The larger N you choose,the better your PC perform.)

## Files
+ Main: After running, the computer reads the data of Probability to adjust the strategy of playing cards and play games with the players.

+ Train: Data on multiple rounds of points and wins and losses are obtained through self-confrontation,then 'train_data.csv' will be created.

+ Probability: Calculate the data generated by 'train_data.csv' to get the winning rate based on the current number of points

+ Probability results: A lot of self-confrontation leads to a winning or losing table.
